#
# DataFrame.groupBy is simply an equivalent of the "GROUP BY"
# clause in standard SQL. In other words
#
# df.groupBy("foo", "bar")
# is equivalent to:
#
# SELECT foo, bar, [agg-expressions] 
#   FROM table 
#     GROUP BY foo, bar
#
# cube is equivalent to CUBE extension to GROUP BY. 
# It takes a list of columns and applies aggregate 
# expressions to all possible combinations of the 
# grouping columns. Lets say you have data like this:
#
# df.show()
#
#  +---+---+
#  |  x|  y|
#  +---+---+
#  |foo|  1|
#  |foo|  2|
#  |bar|  2|
#  |bar|  2|
#  +---+---+
# 
# and you compute cube(x, y) with count as an aggregation:
#
# df.cube("x", "y").count.show()
#
# +----+----+-----+     
# |   x|   y|count|
# +----+----+-----+
# |null|   1|    1|   <- count of records where y = 1
# |null|   2|    3|   <- count of records where y = 2
# | foo|null|    2|   <- count of records where x = foo
# | bar|   2|    2|   <- count of records where x = bar AND y = 2
# | foo|   1|    1|   <- count of records where x = foo AND y = 1
# | foo|   2|    1|   <- count of records where x = foo AND y = 2
# |null|null|    4|   <- total count of records
# | bar|null|    2|   <- count of records where x = bar
# +----+----+-----+
#
# A similar function to cube is rollup which computes hierarchical 
# subtotals from left to right:
#
# df.rollup("x", "y").count.show()
#  +----+----+-----+
#  |   x|   y|count|
#  +----+----+-----+
#  | foo|null|    2|   <- count where x is fixed to foo
#  | bar|   2|    2|   <- count where x is fixed to bar and y is fixed to  2
#  | foo|   1|    1|   ...
#  | foo|   2|    1|   ...
#  |null|null|    4|   <- count where no column is fixed
#  | bar|null|    2|   <- count where x is fixed to bar
#  +----+----+-----+
#
# Just for comparison lets see the result of plain groupBy:
#
# df.groupBy("x", "y").count.show()
#
#  +---+---+-----+
#  |  x|  y|count|
#  +---+---+-----+
#  |foo|  1|    1|   <- this is identical to x = foo AND y = 1 in CUBE or ROLLUP
#  |foo|  2|    1|   <- this is identical to x = foo AND y = 2 in CUBE or ROLLUP
#  |bar|  2|    2|   <- this is identical to x = bar AND y = 2 in CUBE or ROLLUP
#  +---+---+-----+
#
# To summarize:
#
# When using plain GROUP BY every row is included only once 
# in its corresponding summary.
#
# With GROUP BY CUBE(..) every row is included in summary of 
# each combination of levels it represents, wildcards included. 
# Logically, the shown above is equivalent to something like this 
# (assuming we could use NULL placeholders):
#
#   SELECT NULL, NULL, COUNT(*) FROM table
#   UNION ALL
#   SELECT x,    NULL, COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY x
#   UNION ALL
#   SELECT NULL, y,    COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY y
#   UNION ALL
#   SELECT x,    y,    COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY x, y
#
#
# With GROUP BY ROLLUP(...) is similar to CUBE but works 
# hierarchically by filling colums from left to right.
#
#   SELECT NULL, NULL, COUNT(*) FROM table
#   UNION ALL
#   SELECT x,    NULL, COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY x
#   UNION ALL
#   SELECT x,    y,    COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY x, y
#
#
# ROLLUP and CUBE come from data warehousing extensions so 
# if you want to get a better understanding how this works 
# you can also check documentation of your favorite RDMBS. 
# For example PostgreSQL introduced both in 9.5 and these are 
# relatively well documented.
